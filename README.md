There is another feature for this app that allows the user to have their own task list just by adding a route to the URL.

For example, If the user intends to have a task list of their School projects, they can easily go the url:
http://domain.com/shools

!["url customized"](/url.png)

the name of the list which is schools in this case, can also be displayed as the title of the page. No matter if the user types the route capitalized, uppercase or camelcase. By using Lodash package this problem got fixed.

!["customized task list name"](/task.png)
